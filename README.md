Artemis Financial is a consulting company. The wanted Global Rain to modfernize their operations and secure their web-based application. In this assignment I was tasked with addressing potential vulnerabilities and provide a mitigation plan. The first thing I did when I found security vulnerabilities was document them. Documenting security vulnerabilities is an important practice within the computer science field. Vulnerabilities are extremely important to address for Artemis Financial being that they are a consulting company. At first the most challenging part for me was the static testing because I had never ran a static test but I learned how and had to run several throughout the course. In later assignments I used algorithm ciphers to enhance security. The one that I used the most was SHA-256 because I found it to be the most secure. After refactoring code, in order to ensure I didn't create any new vulnerabilities I ran a static test. The resources and tools I used that may be useful in future assignmenta are dependency checks and algorithm ciphers. For a future employer, I would show them my approach and analysis of Artemis FInancial.
